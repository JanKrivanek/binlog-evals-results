<a href="#user-content-ref-1" id="fn-1"><strong>[1]</strong></a> (Plugin) Quality improved but weighted score is -3.8% due to: completion (✓ → ✗), tokens (754836 → 3592632), tool calls (29 → 73)
<a href="#user-content-ref-2" id="fn-2"><strong>[2]</strong></a> (Isolated) Quality unchanged but weighted score is -22.8% due to: completion (✓ → ✗), tokens (228761 → 768884), tool calls (14 → 28)

> ⏰ **timeout** — run(s) hit the scenario timeout limit; scoring may be impacted by aborting model execution before it could produce its full output (increase via `timeout` in eval.yaml)
