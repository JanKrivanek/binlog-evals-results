<a href="#user-content-ref-1" id="fn-1"><strong>[1]</strong></a> (Isolated) Quality unchanged but weighted score is -16.1% due to: completion (✓ → ✗), tokens (1342015 → 3015122), tool calls (38 → 62), time (710.8s → 1096.7s)

> ⏰ **timeout** — run(s) hit the scenario timeout limit; scoring may be impacted by aborting model execution before it could produce its full output (increase via `timeout` in eval.yaml)
