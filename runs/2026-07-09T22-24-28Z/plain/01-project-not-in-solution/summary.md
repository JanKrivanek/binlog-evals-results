<a href="#user-content-ref-1" id="fn-1"><strong>[1]</strong></a> (Isolated) Quality unchanged but weighted score is -13.2% due to: tokens (27686 → 84299), quality, tool calls (2 → 6), time (14.6s → 50.0s)

> ⏰ **timeout** — run(s) hit the scenario timeout limit; scoring may be impacted by aborting model execution before it could produce its full output (increase via `timeout` in eval.yaml)
